**Purpose.** Community questions and lightweight collaboration for one-off utilities published *as-is*.

We use **GitHub Discussions** for Q&A, troubleshooting, and “how do I…” topics.

> Issues in this repo are for bugs and changes to the scripts themselves.
> If you accidentally open a question as an issue, a bot will kindly nudge it over to Discussions.
