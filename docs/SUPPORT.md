# Support Policy

**Status:** This repository is published *as‑is* with **no ongoing maintenance**.

We release small, one‑off utilities that may be useful to others. We cannot promise fixes, feature requests, or timely reviews. If something here works for you—great! If not, feel free to fork and adapt.

## 🐞 Issues
- Issues may be disabled or triaged minimally.
- If enabled, please include:
  - exact command(s) you ran
  - environment (OS + versions)
  - error output
  - a minimal repro if possible

## 🔀 Pull Requests
PRs are welcome but not guaranteed a review or merge.
- Keep changes small and focused (one topic per PR).
- Include a brief rationale and usage example.
- Avoid adding external dependencies unless essential.
- Prefer POSIX‑friendly shell and widely available CLI tools.

## 🔐 Security
These scripts are published for transparency and reuse, but **we do not operate a formal security response process** for this repo.
- Do **not** send sensitive reports privately; there is no dedicated security inbox.
- If an obvious safety issue exists, open an issue (if enabled) or a PR with a direct fix.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & releases
There is no roadmap. Tags/releases are snapshot markers for convenience only.
